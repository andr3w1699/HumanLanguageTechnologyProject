Otherwise, you'd swear this is Evanescence's experimental follow-up album. But in the end this is Melodic Hard Rock with many catchy hooks/choruses and songs that could easily be played on the radio. The role of the violin here is just as vital as the role of a guitar, dominating throughout the record and enhancing the music. Without it, this record would probably be extremely unoriginal. Basic, yet energetic female vocals keep the flow of the music listenable. There are some brilliant musical passages like in the song \"Shut Up\" (1:46-2:14), as well as silly male verbal chants (like on \"Blah Blah\" 2:56-3:10), but overall the harmlessness and accessibility of the material is enough to satisfy the open-minded ear.  \n",

Overall, I expect it to be a handy quick-reference that will give some insight without too much detail.  \n",

              "2877965  I've been using this mouse pad for a little over a month now, and there's no other way to describe it except 'superb'. Or I guess you could insert your personal favorite superlative. 'excellent' also works nicely.Anyway, the mouse pad itself is actually just shy of being as big as my monitor (19\"). So, you can have your sensitivity as low as you want and not ever. run out of room. Ever. Seriously. I personally like the control side the most - for some reason I just feel more... in control or my mouse. Compared to my generic cloth mouse pad that I've had for the past 3 computers , this thing makes it seem as though my mouse is levitating. (I'm using the razer copperhead mouse, by the way.)Oh, and the squishy wrist rest is sure to keep my wrist safe from carpal tunnel for good while. It's really quite comfortable.All jokes aside, this is definitely the best mouse pad I've ever owned. If you've never had anything but a cloth mouse pad (or no mouse pad) prepare to be amazed.  \n",

My youngest just wasnt going for the routine. it took several months to find a smooth schedule for him.

Otherwise, you'd swear this is Evanescence's experimental follow-up album. But in the end this is Melodic Hard Rock with many catchy hooks/choruses and songs that could easily be played on the radio. The role of the violin here is just as vital as the role of a guitar, dominating throughout the record and enhancing the music. Without it, this record would probably be extremely unoriginal. Basic, yet energetic female vocals keep the flow of the music listenable. There are some brilliant musical passages like in the song \"Shut Up\" (1:46-2:14), as well as silly male verbal chants (like on \"Blah Blah\" 2:56-3:10), but overall the harmlessness and accessibility of the material is enough to satisfy the open-minded ear.</td>\n",

So, you can have your sensitivity as low as you want and not ever. run out of room. Ever. Seriously. I personally like the control side the most - for some reason I just feel more... in control or my mouse. Compared to my generic cloth mouse pad that I've had for the past 3 computers , this thing makes it seem as though my mouse is levitating. (I'm using the razer copperhead mouse, by the way.)Oh, and the squishy wrist rest is sure to keep my wrist safe from carpal tunnel for good while.

All others beware! It is absolute drivel. I figured I was in trouble when a typo is prominently featured on the back cover, but the first page of the book removed all doubt. Wait - maybe I'm missing the point. A quick re-read of the beginning now makes it clear. This has to be an intentional churning of over-heated prose for satiric purposes.

This book seems to have been written by a 7th grader with poor grammatical skills for her age! As another reviewer points out, there is a misspelling on the cover, and I believe there is at least one per chapter. For example, it was mentioned twice that she had a \"lean\" on her house. I was so distracted by the poor writing and weak plot, that I decided to read with a pencil in hand to mark all of the horrible grammar and spelling. Please don't waste your money. I too, believe that the good reviews must have been written by the author's relatives. I will not put much faith in the reviews from now on!   \n",

This in my opinino is Yasunori Mitsuda's ultimate masterpiece. The music is timeless and I'm been listening to it for years now and its beauty simply refuses to fade.The price tag on this is pretty staggering I must say, but if you are going to buy any cd for this much money, this is the only one that I feel would be worth every penny.   \n",

Some of my favourite tracks include; \"Scars Left by Time, The Girl who Stole the Stars, and Another World\".   \n",

              "6   This is a self-published book, and if you want to know why--read a few paragraphs! Those 5 star reviews must have been written by Ms. Haddon's family and friends--or perhaps, by herself! I can't imagine anyone reading the whole thing--I spent an evening with the book and a friend and we were in hysterics reading bits and pieces of it to one another. It is most definitely bad enough to be entered into some kind of a \"worst book\" contest. I can't believe Amazon even sells this kind of thing. Maybe I can offer them my 8th grade term paper on \"To Kill a Mockingbird\"--a book I am quite sure Ms. Haddon never heard of. Anyway, unless you are in a mood to send a book to someone as a joke---stay far, far away from this one!   \n",

This book seems to have been written by a 7th grader with poor grammatical skills for her age! As another reviewer points out, there is a misspelling on the cover, and I believe there is at least one per chapter. For example, it was mentioned twice that she had a \"lean\" on her house. I was so distracted by the poor writing and weak plot, that I decided to read with a pencil in hand to mark all of the horrible grammar and spelling. Please don't waste your money. I too, believe that the good reviews must have been written by the author's relatives. I will not put much faith in the reviews from now on!   \n",

I'm reading a lot of reviews saying that this is the best 'game soundtrack' and I figured that I'd write a review to disagree a bit. This in my opinino is Yasunori Mitsuda's ultimate masterpiece. The music is timeless and I'm been listening to it for years now and its beauty simply refuses to fade.The price tag on this is pretty staggering I must say, but if you are going to buy any cd for this much money, this is the only one that I feel would be worth every penny.  \n",

This book seems to have been written by a 7th grader with poor grammatical skills for her age! As another reviewer points out, there is a misspelling on the cover, and I believe there is at least one per chapter. For example, it was mentioned twice that she had a \"lean\" on her house. I was so distracted by the poor writing and weak plot, that I decided to read with a pencil in hand to mark all of the horrible grammar and spelling. Please don't waste your money. I too, believe that the good reviews must have been written by the author's relatives. I will not put much faith in the reviews from now on!  "

This in my opinino is Yasunori Mitsuda's ultimate masterpiece. The music is timeless and I'm been listening to it for years now and its beauty simply refuses to fade.The price tag on this is pretty staggering I must say, but if you are going to buy any cd for this much money, this is the only one that I feel would be worth every penny.   \n",

While ambiance is one of the music's major factors, yet at times it's very uplifting and vigorous. Some of my favourite tracks include; \"Scars Left by Time, The Girl who Stole the Stars, and Another World\".   \n",

              "6   This is a self-published book, and if you want to know why--read a few paragraphs! Those 5 star reviews must have been written by Ms. Haddon's family and friends--or perhaps, by herself! I can't imagine anyone reading the whole thing--I spent an evening with the book and a friend and we were in hysterics reading bits and pieces of it to one another. It is most definitely bad enough to be entered into some kind of a \"worst book\" contest. I can't believe Amazon even sells this kind of thing. Maybe I can offer them my 8th grade term paper on \"To Kill a Mockingbird\"--a book I am quite sure Ms. Haddon never heard of. Anyway, unless you are in a mood to send a book to someone as a joke---stay far, far away from this one!   \n",

This book seems to have been written by a 7th grader with poor grammatical skills for her age! As another reviewer points out, there is a misspelling on the cover, and I believe there is at least one per chapter. For example, it was mentioned twice that she had a \"lean\" on her house. I was so distracted by the poor writing and weak plot, that I decided to read with a pencil in hand to mark all of the horrible grammar and spelling. Please don't waste your money. I too, believe that the good reviews must have been written by the author's relatives. I will not put much faith in the reviews from now on!   \n",
